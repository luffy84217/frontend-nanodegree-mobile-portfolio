# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.


### Prerequisites

In order to use Google Image Crawler, you must have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


### Installing

To install the dependencies, enter the following in your terminal:

```
$ cd your-project-path
$ npm install
```

## Running the npm scripts

Here are some npm scripts about Google Image Crawler that I had set for project.

### Starting the App

To start the app, make sure you're in the project directory and use CLI.
This script is equal to `$ http-server`.

```
$ npm start
```

## Results

Here the pictures are the results that after testing on PageSpeed Insights.

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
